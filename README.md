# Pressure Vessel Dished End Calculator

A React + Vite utility application for estimating the geometry, blank size, weight, visual layout, and printable QC report of pressure vessel dished ends.

This project is the modular application version of the original single-file calculator stored in `app.html`. The old file remains in the repository as the functional baseline, while the current app is implemented in typed, maintainable source modules under `src/`.

## Overview

The calculator is intended for quick engineering-oriented configuration of formed dished ends based on:

- `DIN 28011`
- `DIN 28013`
- `SS 895`

The application lets the user:

- choose a supported head standard
- define outer diameter, wall thickness, straight flange, and material
- define weld edge preparation parameters
- add and position nozzles on the head sketch
- preview the head profile in SVG
- review derived manufacturing values
- generate a print-friendly QC / manufacturing report

The goal of this refactor is to preserve the behavior of the original calculator while making the code easier to extend, validate, test, and deploy.

## User Guide

### 1. Select the head standard

The first section of the application allows the user to choose between:

- `DIN28011`
- `DIN28013`
- `SS895`

The selected standard controls the geometry formulas used for:

- crown radius `R`
- knuckle radius `r`
- dish depth `h2`
- blank diameter factor

### 2. Enter the main geometry

In the `Geometry & Material` panel the user provides:

- `Diameter (Da)` in mm
- `Thickness (s)` in mm
- `Straight Flange (h1)` in mm
- material selection

These values are the main input parameters for the geometry and weight estimation.

### 3. Configure weld edge preparation

The `Weld Edge Prep` panel supports:

- `None (Square Cut)`
- `V-Bevel (Outside)`

When `V-Bevel` is selected, two more parameters become active:

- bevel angle
- root face

These values affect the rendered section profile and are also shown in the report.

### 4. Add nozzles

The `Nozzles` panel allows the user to create simple nozzle markers for layout visualization.

Each nozzle contains:

- nominal size, such as `DN50`
- horizontal offset from the centerline

Nozzles are displayed in the SVG preview and also appear in the printed report sketch.

### 5. Review calculated output

When inputs are valid, the application computes and displays:

- crown radius `R`
- knuckle radius `r`
- dish depth `h2`
- total height `H`
- estimated blank diameter
- estimated weight
- approximate volume
- tolerance values

### 6. Generate the report

The `QC Report (PDF)` button opens a print-oriented report view and automatically triggers the browser print dialog when possible.

The report includes:

- design data
- nominal dimensions
- visual section sketch
- QC measurement table
- tolerance references
- signature placeholders

## Validation Behavior

The app does not silently accept invalid engineering input.

Validation currently checks:

- outer diameter must be greater than zero
- thickness must be greater than zero
- thickness must remain below half of the outer diameter
- straight flange must be at least `10 mm`
- bevel angle must be between `0` and `90` degrees when bevel mode is enabled
- root face must be greater than zero and smaller than thickness
- nozzle offsets must stay within the available visual span of the head

When a value is invalid:

- the validation panel shows the problem
- the engineering preview is paused
- report generation is disabled

## Engineering Logic

The core engineering formulas are preserved from the legacy implementation.

### Supported standards

#### DIN 28011

- `R = Da`
- `r = 0.1 * Da`
- `h2 = 0.1935 * Da - 0.455 * s`
- blank diameter factor = `1.09`

#### DIN 28013

- `R = 0.8 * Da`
- `r = 0.154 * Da`
- `h2 = 0.255 * Da - 0.635 * s`
- blank diameter factor = `1.14`

#### SS 895

- `R = Da`
- `r = 0.1 * Da`
- `h2 = 0.1935 * Da`
- blank diameter factor = `1.09`

### Derived values

The application also computes:

- `totalHeight = h1 + h2 + s`
- `blankDiameter = factor * Da + 2 * h1`
- approximate blank area from the blank diameter
- estimated material volume from area and thickness
- estimated weight using simple density rules
- approximate vessel volume using the legacy simplified method

### Material density assumption

Weight estimation currently uses:

- `7.9` for materials whose name contains `Stainless`
- `7.85` for all other materials

This is intentionally simple because it reflects the original calculator behavior.

## Main Files And Responsibilities

### `app.html`

The original standalone calculator. It is kept as a reference implementation for migration parity and legacy behavior comparison.

### `index.html`

The Vite entry HTML that mounts the React application.

### `src/main.tsx`

The client bootstrap file. It mounts the root React component into the DOM.

### `src/App.tsx`

The main application container.

Primary responsibilities:

- stores form state
- stores nozzle list state
- runs validation through `validateForm`
- runs calculations through `calculateGeometry`
- computes approximate volume
- toggles the report view
- triggers browser printing
- composes the user interface panels

Main function:

- `validateForm(form, nozzleForms)`

Responsibilities:

- parses user-entered strings into numbers

- responsive behavior
- print mode
- report layout

## Runtime Flow

The application runtime is intentionally straightforward:

1. User edits form values in `App.tsx`
2. Raw string inputs are validated in `validateForm`
3. If validation succeeds, parsed config is passed to `calculateGeometry`
4. Drawing helpers prepare SVG geometry and nozzle placement
5. `PreviewPanel` renders the live engineering preview
6. `ReportView` renders the print-ready document when opened

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Build Output

The Vite build is generated in:

```text
dist/
```

For deployment, the GitHub Actions workflow converts the build output into a website-friendly bundle:

- `dist/index.html` becomes `app.html`
- `dist/assets/*` is published as `assets/*`

This allows the website repository to keep serving the utility from:

```text
static/utility-apps/pressure-vessel-dished-end-calc/app.html
```

## Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow in:

```text
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Workflow summary:

1. checks out this repository
2. installs dependencies with `npm ci`
3. builds the application with `npm run build`
4. prepares a deploy bundle with `app.html` and `assets/`
5. pushes the built output to the website repository `cadautoscript.com`

Target deployment path in the website repository:

```text
static/utility-apps/pressure-vessel-dished-end-calc
```

## Notes For Developers

- The legacy `app.html` should be treated as the behavioral reference when changing formulas or UI flow.
- If engineering logic changes, update both the UI behavior and this documentation.
- Keep validation conservative. It is better to block impossible configurations than to produce misleading results.
- The current report flow uses the browser print dialog rather than generating a binary PDF file in code.

## Known Limitations

- Weight and volume calculations are simplified and intended for quick estimation, not code-level design verification.
- Nozzle handling is visual and positional only; it does not perform reinforcement or stress calculations.
- Material density handling is simplified.
- The report is print-oriented rather than a full document export engine.
